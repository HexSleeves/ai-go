# Product Requirement Document: Go Roguelike with Gruid

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple roguelike game built using the Go programming language and the `gruid` terminal UI library.

## 2. Goals

- Create a basic, playable roguelike experience in the terminal.
- Implement core roguelike mechanics (map exploration, player movement, potentially FOV, simple monsters/combat later).
- Utilize an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture for game state management.
- Serve as a learning project for Go, `gruid`, and ECS patterns.

## 3. Core Requirements

- **Map:** A grid-based map composed of walls and floors.
- **Player:** A controllable character represented by '@'.
- **Rendering:** Display the map and player character in the terminal.
- **Architecture:** Use an ECS pattern.
- **Technology:** Go language, `gruid` library.

## 4. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

- Map Generation Algorithms
- Field of View (FOV)
- Monster Entities & Basic AI
- Combat System
- Items & Inventory
- Game UI Elements (Messages, Stats)
