# Roguelike Game Project: Onboarding Complete

## Overview

The AI-driven development workflow has been successfully set up for your roguelike game project. This report summarizes the onboarding process and available features.

## Onboarding Actions Completed

1. **Directory Structure Created**
   - `.cursor/specs/` - For specifications and requirements
   - `.cursor/tasks/` - For task tracking and management
   - `.cursor/learnings/` - For knowledge capture
   - `.cursor/docs/` - For documentation
   - `.cursor/output/` - For generated reports
   - `.cursor/rules/` - Already contained system rules

2. **Project Analysis**
   - Analyzed project structure and organization
   - Identified key components and systems
   - Documented architecture and design patterns
   - Identified potential improvement areas

3. **Initial Documentation**
   - Created specification index and example specifications
   - Set up task tracking system with example tasks
   - Established knowledge management with example learnings
   - Generated initial codebase analysis report

## Available AI-Driven Workflows

### Specification Management

Use commands like:

- `spec create "Feature Name"` - Create a new specification
- `spec update "path/to/spec.md"` - Update an existing specification
- `spec validate "path/to/spec.md"` - Validate specification quality

### Task Management

Use commands like:

- `task create "Task Description"` - Create a new task
- `task start "TASK-ID"` - Mark a task as active
- `task done "TASK-ID"` - Complete a task
- `task list` - View all tasks

### Knowledge Management

Use commands like:

- `learn add "Title" "Description"` - Create a new learning
- `learn categorize` - Organize learnings by category
- `learn metrics` - Generate knowledge capture metrics

### Code Commands

Use commands like:

- `Code.analyze` - Analyze code structure and quality
- `Code.refactor:file/path.go` - Generate refactoring suggestions

## Next Steps

1. **Review Generated Specifications**
   - Examine the specifications in `.cursor/specs/`
   - Update or add specifications as needed

2. **Prioritize Tasks**
   - Review the task list in `.cursor/tasks/TASKS.md`
   - Add or modify tasks based on project priorities

3. **Use Knowledge Management**
   - Start capturing learnings during development
   - Review existing learnings for insights

4. **Try AI Commands**
   - Test the various AI-powered commands
   - Explore visualization and analysis features

## Conclusion

Your roguelike game project is now set up for AI-driven development. The established workflow integrates specification-first development, task management, and knowledge capture without modifying your existing codebase.

As you continue development, the AI assistant will help maintain specifications, track tasks, capture knowledge, and improve code quality based on this framework.
