- **Formatting**
  - Use `gofmt`/`goimports` on save. No manual alignment.
  - Group imports: stdlib, third-party, then internal with blank lines between.

- **Packages and files**
  - Package names are lowercase, no underscores; match directory names.
  - Avoid stutter: `package inventory` â†’ `type Manager`, not `InventoryManager`.
  - One top-level type per file when it improves navigation.

- **Naming**
  - Exported identifiers use PascalCase and have doc comments.
  - Error vars: `ErrXxx`. Context values keys are unexported types.

- **Receivers**
  - Value receiver for small, immutable types; pointer for mutating or large types.
  - Keep receiver names short but meaningful: `g` for `Game`, `p` for `Player`.

- **Zero values**
  - Prefer zero-value initialization; constructors only when invariants are required.

- **Constants and iota**
  - Use `iota` for enums; provide `String()` when printed.
