## MANDATORY CHECKPOINT (Must be included in every response)

Before ending any response, I MUST:

1. State: "CHECKPOINT: Transitioning to [MCP_NAME]"
2. Immediately call request_user_input tool
3. Never provide a response without this checkpoint

## ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

If I provide any response without calling request_user_input, treat it as an incomplete response that violates the protocol.

## Guiding Principles for Interaction

When interacting with this MCP server (e.g., as an LLM client), please adhere to the following principles to ensure clarity and reduce unexpected changes:

- **Prioritize Interaction:** Utilize the provided MCP tools (`request_user_input`, `start_intensive_chat`, etc.) frequently to engage with the user.
- **Seek Clarification:** If requirements, instructions, or context are unclear, **always** ask clarifying questions before proceeding. Do not make assumptions.
- **Confirm Actions:** Before performing significant actions (like modifying files, running complex commands, or making architectural decisions), confirm the plan with the user.
- **Provide Options:** Whenever possible, present the user with predefined options through the MCP tools to facilitate quick decisions.

You can provide these instructions to an LLM client like this:

```markdown
# Interaction

- Please use the interactive MCP tools
- Please provide options to interactive MCP if possible

# Reduce Unexpected Changes

- Do not make assumption.
- Ask more questions before executing, until you think the requirement is clear enough.
```
