# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the development workflow of the Golang roguelike game built with the gruid library. The current game has a solid foundation with ECS architecture, advanced AI systems, pathfinding, and turn-based mechanics. However, the development workflow lacks structured processes for feature development, content creation, game balancing, and quality assurance.

The goal is to transform the current ad-hoc development approach into a systematic, spec-driven workflow that enables rapid iteration, consistent quality, and scalable content creation while maintaining the game's architectural integrity.
