# Active Context: Go Roguelike with Gruid (As of 2025-03-31 ~9:45 PM)

## Current Focus

- Implement Basic Map Generation (Task 1 in `tasks/tasks_plan.md`).
- Implement Player Movement (Task 2 in `tasks/tasks_plan.md`).

## Recent Changes / Activity

- Created `docs/product_requirement_docs.md` with initial project goals and scope.
- Created `docs/architecture.md` detailing the ECS structure and component relationships.
- Created `docs/technical.md` outlining the tech stack and key decisions.
- Created `tasks/tasks_plan.md` summarizing completed work based on `ROGUELIKE_GUIDE_PLAN.md` and outlining the backlog.
- Added `DrawMap` function to `map.go` (using `gruid.ColorDefault` as placeholder).
- Integrated `DrawMap` call into `model.Draw` in `model.go`.
- Implemented basic map generation (`generateMap` in `map.go`).
- Updated `NewMap` to use `generateMap` and return player start position.
- Updated `main.go` to use the returned player start position.
- Created placeholder `.cursor/rules/error-documentation.mdc`.
- Created placeholder `.cursor/rules/lessons-learned.mdc`.

## Current State Summary

- Core ECS implementation is in place.
- Player entity is created with basic components.
- Rendering pipeline draws map tiles (currently static) and then entities.
- Basic map generation with rooms/corridors is implemented.
- Player starts in the center of the first room.
- Project lacks player movement, FOV, and other core roguelike features.
- Core documentation files (`product_requirement_docs.md`, `architecture.md`, `technical.md`, `tasks_plan.md`) have been created with initial content.

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. Begin implementation of Basic Map Generation.
2. Follow the sub-tasks outlined in `tasks/tasks_plan.md` for map generation.
1. Begin implementation of Player Movement.
2. Handle keyboard input in `model.Update`.
3. Implement movement logic (checking collisions).
