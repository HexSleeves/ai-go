# Active Context: Go Roguelike with Gruid (As of 2025-04-02 ~10:39 PM)

## Current Focus

- Implement Field of View (FOV) (Task 3 in `tasks/tasks_plan.md`).
- Refine Colors (Task 4 in `tasks/tasks_plan.md`).

## Recent Changes / Activity

- Created `docs/product_requirement_docs.md` with initial project goals and scope.
- Created `docs/architecture.md` detailing the ECS structure and component relationships.
- Created `docs/technical.md` outlining the tech stack and key decisions.
- Created `tasks/tasks_plan.md` summarizing completed work based on `ROGUELIKE_GUIDE_PLAN.md` and outlining the backlog.
- Added `DrawMap` function to `map.go` (using `gruid.ColorDefault` as placeholder).
- Integrated `DrawMap` call into `model.Draw` in `model.go`.
- Implemented basic map generation (`generateMap` in `map.go`).
- Updated `NewMap` to use `generateMap` and return player start position.
- Updated `main.go` to use the returned player start position.
- Created placeholder `.cursor/rules/error-documentation.mdc`.
- Created placeholder `.cursor/rules/lessons-learned.mdc`.
- Implemented player movement with arrow keys and collision detection.
- Added keyboard input handling in `model.Update`.
- Added movement logic with wall collision checks.

## Current State Summary

- Core ECS implementation is in place.
- Player entity is created with basic components.
- Rendering pipeline draws map tiles (currently static) and then entities.
- Basic map generation with rooms/corridors is implemented.
- Player starts in the center of the first room.
- Player can move around using arrow keys with wall collision detection.
- Project lacks FOV, colors, monsters, and other advanced roguelike features.
- Core documentation files (`product_requirement_docs.md`, `architecture.md`, `technical.md`, `tasks_plan.md`) have been created with initial content.

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. Begin implementation of Field of View (FOV):
   - Integrate `gruid/fov` package
   - Add FOV computation when player moves
   - Update rendering to respect visibility
2. Refine Colors:
   - Define color constants
   - Update map and entity rendering to use proper colors
   - Add visual distinction for explored but not visible tiles
