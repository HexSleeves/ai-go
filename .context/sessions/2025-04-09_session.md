# Development Session Log

## Focus
- Refactoring update function for clear input/turn processing separation (TASK-003)

## Context
- Working on core game engine improvements
- Focus on turn system and input handling separation
- Emphasis on code clarity and maintainability

## Progress
- Completed TASK-003: Refactor Update Function
  - Separated input handling from turn processing
  - Improved state management
  - Enhanced debugging capabilities
  - Fixed screen update inconsistencies
  - Added comprehensive logging

## Decisions
- Implemented state pattern for turn phases
- Added runtime assertions for state validation
- Enhanced logging system for better debugging
- Separated concerns between input and turn processing

## Self-Improvement
- Pattern Insights:
  - Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability
  - State validation helps catch issues early
  - Comprehensive logging aids debugging
- Efficiency Insights:
  - Proper state management reduces bugs
  - Early validation prevents cascading issues
- Process Insights:
  - Breaking down complex functions improves clarity
  - Adding debug tools during refactoring is valuable

## Dependencies
None - This was a self-contained refactoring task

## Next Steps
1. Monitor performance metrics of new implementation
2. Consider adding more advanced state validation
3. Add more debug visualization features as needed
4. Keep documentation updated with changes

## Notes
- Successfully improved code organization
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Better state management implemented
- Screen update consistency improved
