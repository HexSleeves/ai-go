# Development Session: 2025-04-09

## Focus
- Initial project setup and configuration
- Framework initialization
- Project planning preparation
- Core task creation
- Update function refactoring task

## Context
- Starting new development session with Aegis framework
- Core framework structure is in place
- Project plan created for AI-Go implementation
- Initial tasks created for core game engine
- Identified need for update function refactoring

## Progress
- [x] Initialized session document
- [x] Reviewed current project state
- [x] Validated task states
- [x] Set initial development focus
- [x] Created comprehensive project plan
- [x] Created initial core engine tasks
- [x] Created update function refactoring task

## Decisions
- Project requires initial planning phase before task creation
- Focusing on core game engine as Phase 1
- Using modular design approach for components
- Prioritizing correctness over performance initially
- Need to improve turn processing and input handling

## Self-Improvement
Initial session metrics:
- Framework structure validated
- Project plan created with clear phases
- 3 core tasks created with dependencies
- Planning phase completed successfully
- Identified critical refactoring needs

## Dependencies
Core task dependencies established:
- TASK-002 depends on TASK-001 completion
- TASK-003 (refactoring) can be done independently

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of TASK-001 (Board Representation)
2. Set up development environment
3. Create initial test framework
4. Consider starting TASK-003 in parallel for better architecture

## Notes
- Session started at 2025-04-09T01:08:00
- Framework initialization complete
- Project plan established
- Ready for core engine development
- Consider creating more tasks for Phase 1
- Update function refactoring will improve maintainability
