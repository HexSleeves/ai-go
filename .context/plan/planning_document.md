# AI-Go Project Plan

## Overview
Development of an AI-powered Go game implementation. This project aims to create a modern, efficient Go game engine with AI capabilities for both learning and competitive play. The system will provide both a game engine and an AI opponent, making Go accessible to players of all skill levels.

## Objectives
- Create a robust Go game engine implementing complete game rules
- Develop an AI opponent using modern machine learning techniques
- Build an intuitive user interface for game play
- Implement game state persistence and analysis tools
- Support standard Go game formats (SGF) for import/export

## Components
1. **Core Game Engine**
   - Description: Implementation of Go rules and game mechanics
   - Tasks:
     - Implement board representation and state management
     - Create move validation system
     - Develop scoring and territory calculation
     - Implement capture and ko rule handling
     - Add game state serialization/deserialization

2. **AI System**
   - Description: AI opponent implementation and training system
   - Tasks:
     - Design AI model architecture
     - Implement position evaluation system
     - Create move prediction system
     - Develop training pipeline
     - Add difficulty levels and playing styles

3. **User Interface**
   - Description: Game visualization and interaction layer
   - Tasks:
     - Create board visualization
     - Implement move input system
     - Add game state display (captures, territory, score)
     - Create game replay functionality
     - Implement save/load features

4. **Game Analysis Tools**
   - Description: Tools for analyzing and improving gameplay
   - Tasks:
     - Create move analysis system
     - Implement game record review tools
     - Add position evaluation display
     - Create game statistics tracking
     - Implement SGF format support

## Dependencies
- Core Game Engine must be completed before AI System integration
- Basic UI components needed for testing Game Engine
- Analysis Tools depend on both Game Engine and AI System
- SGF support needed for game import/export features

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (1 month): Core Game Engine Development
  - Board representation and basic rules
  - Move validation and game state management
  - Initial UI for testing

- Phase 2 (1 month): AI System Implementation
  - Basic AI model development
  - Position evaluation system
  - Move prediction implementation
  - Initial training pipeline

- Phase 3 (1 month): UI and Analysis Tools
  - Complete user interface
  - Game analysis features
  - SGF support
  - Final integration and testing

## Success Criteria
- Complete implementation of Go rules with all edge cases handled
- AI opponent capable of playing at various skill levels
- Intuitive and responsive user interface
- Support for standard Go game formats (SGF)
- Comprehensive game analysis tools
- Performance meeting real-time interaction requirements

## Notes
- Focus on modular design for easy testing and maintenance
- Prioritize core game rules correctness
- Consider performance implications in board size scaling
- Plan for future network play capability
- Document AI training process for reproducibility

## Next Steps
- Create initial project structure
- Set up development environment
- Begin core game engine implementation
- Create first UI prototype for testing
