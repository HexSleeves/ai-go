# Refactor Update Function for Clear Input/Turn Processing Separation

## Description
The current update function in `roguelike-gruid-project/internal/game/model_update.go` needs refactoring to better separate player input handling from turn processing. This will improve code clarity, maintainability, and fix potential bugs in the turn queue processing system.

## Objectives
✓ Separate player input handling from turn processing logic
✓ Improve state management during turn transitions
✓ Fix screen update inconsistencies
✓ Enhance debugging capabilities
✓ Ensure proper coordination between player and monster turns

## Steps
1. Refactor Update Function Structure
   - [x] Create separate function for input processing
   - [x] Create separate function for turn processing
   - [x] Implement clear state transitions
   - [x] Add proper error handling

2. Improve Turn Queue Processing
   - [x] Add queue state validation
   - [x] Implement proper turn transition logic
   - [x] Fix screen update timing
   - [x] Add queue state debugging tools

3. Enhance Player Input Handling
   - [x] Create dedicated input processor
   - [x] Implement input validation
   - [x] Add input state tracking
   - [x] Improve input feedback

4. Add Debugging Support
   - [x] Add detailed logging
   - [x] Implement state assertions
   - [x] Create debug visualization
   - [x] Add performance monitoring

## Progress
- Started implementation on 2025-04-09T01:08:00
- Completed refactoring of update function structure with clear separation of concerns
- Added comprehensive state validation and debugging support
- Implemented enhanced logging and metrics tracking
- Added debug visualization tools
- Completed implementation on 2025-04-09T02:15:00

## Dependencies
None - This is a refactoring task

## Notes
All identified issues have been resolved:
- Player input and turn processing logic are tightly coupled ✓ FIXED
- Screen updates are inconsistent after monster moves ✓ FIXED
- Turn queue processing sometimes continues when it should wait ✓ FIXED
- Debugging turn processing is difficult ✓ FIXED
- State transitions are not clearly defined ✓ FIXED

Implementation completed with:
- Use state pattern for clear turn phases ✓ IMPLEMENTED
- Add comprehensive logging ✓ IMPLEMENTED
- Consider adding debug visualization ✓ IMPLEMENTED
- Implement proper error handling ✓ IMPLEMENTED
- Add runtime assertions for state validation ✓ IMPLEMENTED

## Completion Summary
The update function has been successfully refactored with:
1. Clear separation between input processing and turn management
2. Comprehensive state validation and error handling
3. Enhanced debugging capabilities with metrics tracking
4. Improved screen update consistency
5. Better coordination between player and monster turns

## Future Considerations
1. Monitor performance metrics over time
2. Consider adding more advanced state validation if needed
3. Add more debug visualization features as needed
4. Keep documentation updated with any future changes
