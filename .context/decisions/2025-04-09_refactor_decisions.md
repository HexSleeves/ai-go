# Update Function Refactoring Decisions

## Context
The game's update function needed refactoring to improve clarity and maintainability by separating input handling from turn processing.

## Key Decisions

### 1. State Management
- **Decision**: Implement state pattern for turn phases
- **Rationale**: Clearer state transitions and better control flow
- **Impact**: Improved code clarity and reduced state-related bugs

### 2. Input Processing
- **Decision**: Separate input handling into dedicated component
- **Rationale**: Better separation of concerns and improved maintainability
- **Impact**: Cleaner code structure and easier debugging

### 3. Debugging Support
- **Decision**: Add comprehensive logging and state validation
- **Rationale**: Early detection of issues and easier troubleshooting
- **Impact**: Improved development experience and faster bug resolution

### 4. Screen Updates
- **Decision**: Implement consistent screen update mechanism
- **Rationale**: Fix inconsistencies in visual feedback
- **Impact**: Better user experience and more reliable game state display

## Implementation Notes
- State transitions are now explicitly defined
- Input processing is cleanly separated from turn management
- Debug tools are integrated into the core functionality
- Screen updates are properly synchronized with game state

## Future Considerations
1. Monitor performance impact of new structure
2. Consider adding more advanced state validation
3. Evaluate need for additional debugging features
4. Keep documentation updated with system changes
