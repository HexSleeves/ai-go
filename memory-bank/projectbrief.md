# Project Brief: Roguelike Gruid

## Core Goal

Develop a turn-based roguelike game using the Go programming language and the `gruid` terminal UI library.

## Scope

*   Implement core roguelike mechanics: turn-based movement, map exploration, Field of View (FOV).
*   Utilize an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.
*   Generate procedural dungeon levels with rooms and corridors.
*   Include basic monster AI and player interaction.
*   Render the game state in a terminal interface using `gruid`.

## Non-Goals (Initially)

*   Complex combat systems (detailed stats, skills, etc.).
*   Inventory management.
*   Advanced AI (pathfinding, complex behaviors).
*   Persistence (saving/loading).
*   Multiple dungeon levels or level transitions.
*   Extensive UI elements beyond the core game map.
